## Hello there 👋 As-salamu Alaikum

Welcome. I'm MSK - a Sunni Muslim Bangali who knows very little about a few things. I've recently completed my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about myself (and the world).
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with myself (to learn how to survive in this world).
- 💬 Ask me about nothing. (I know nothing.)
- 📫 How to reach me: Are you sure that you want to reach me? I wonder why.
